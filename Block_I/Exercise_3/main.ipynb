    "## Exercise 3: Solving the Damped Harmonic Oscillator\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "In this notebook, we will solve the differential equation for a damped harmonic oscillator using three different numerical methods: the Euler Forward method (explicit), the Euler Backward method (implicit), and the Crank-Nicholson method (semi-implicit). We will compare the results from each method with the exact analytical solution and analyze how the error and stability of the solution vary with different time step sizes ($\\Delta t$).\n",
    "### Problem Description\n",
    "The damped harmonic oscillator is described by the following second-order differential equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\ddot{x} = -\\omega^2x - \\alpha\\dot{x} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\omega$ is the natural frequency of the oscillator and $\\alpha is the damping coefficient.\n",

    "### Method 1: Euler Forward (Explicit Method)\n",
    "The Euler Forward method, also known as the explicit Euler method, is one of the simplest numerical techniques for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs). It is an explicit method, meaning that the state of the system at the next time step is directly computed from the state at the current time step.\n",

    "- $x_{n+1}$ and $v_{n+1}$ are the updated position and velocity at the next time step $n + 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Euler Forward method is straightforward to implement and computationally inexpensive. However, it has some limitations. It is **only first-order accurate**, meaning the local truncation error is proportional to $\\Delta t^2$, and the global error is proportional to $\\Delta t$. Additionally, the method can be unstable if the time step $\\Delta t$ is too large, especially for stiff differential equations where the solution changes rapidly."

By incorporating aspects of both the current and next time steps in its calculations, the Crank-Nicholson method provides a more balanced and stable solution. This characteristic makes it an attractive choice for problems where maintaining numerical stability is crucial, even when using relatively larger time steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the Crank-Nicholson method is known for its **second-order accuracy**. This means that the error in the numerical solution decreases quadratically as the time step size is reduced. In practical terms, this leads to more accurate results with fewer computational steps compared to first-order methods like the Euler Forward and Euler Backward methods. The second-order accuracy of Crank-Nicholson is a significant improvement, offering a better balance between computational efficiency and solution precision."

    "First, we implement each method. The **Euler Forward method**, while straightforward and fast, uses the current state to predict the next step. The **Euler Backward method** takes a more cautious approach, solving a system of equations at each step to ensure stability. The** Crank-Nicholson method** blends the best of both worlds, averaging current and next steps for improved accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then compare these methods against the exact solution. By plotting them together, we can visually assess how close each method gets to the true behavior of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we perform an error analysis by calculating the absolute error between the numerical solutions and the exact solution. This helps us quantify how accurate each method is over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we explore how the time step $\\Delta t$ impacts the performance of each method. By varying $\\Delta t$ and analyzing the resulting errors, we gain insights into the stability and reliability of these numerical techniques."
