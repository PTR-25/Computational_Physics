    "## Problem description\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we are tasked with solving a tridiagonal system of linear equations using a custom algorithm and comparing its performance with standard methods provided by numpy. A tridiagonal matrix is a special type of square matrix that has non-zero elements only on the main diagonal, the diagonal just above it, and the diagonal just below it. Such systems are common in numerical methods, particularly in the discretization of differential equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tridiagonal system representation\n",
    "A tridiagonal system of equations can be expressed in matrix form as: **$$ A x = r $$**\n",
    "where **$A$** is an $n \\times n $ tridiagonal matrix, **$x$** is the vector of unknowns we need to solve for, and **$r$** is the vector of the constants.\n",
    "\n",
    "The matrix **$A$** has the following structure: \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "d_1 & o_1 & 0 & \\dots & 0 \\\\\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\n",

    "where $d_i$ are the elements on the main diagonal, $o_i$ are the elements on the diagonal above the main diagonal, and $u_i$ are the elements on the diagonal below the main diagonal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to implement a custom solver function `TridiagonalSolver(d, o, u, r)` that efficiently solves this system by taking advantage of the tridiagonal structure of matrix **$A$**."

    "To solve the tridiagonal system, we will use the Thomas algorithm, a simplified form of Gaussian elimination that is optimized for tridiagonal matrices. This algorithm involves two main steps.\n",

    "First, in the forward elimination step, the coefficients of the matrix are modified to convert it into an upper triangular form. This simplification allows us to handle the system more easily in the subsequent step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, in the backward substitution step, we solve for the unknowns starting from the last equation and substitute the known values back into the previous equations. This method efficiently computes the solution by leveraging the structure of the tridiagonal matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "After implementing the custom solver, we will compare its performance with standard methods, including matrix inversion using `numpy.linalg.inv` and direct solution using `numpy.linalg.solve`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we will measure the computational time required by each method for different sizes of the matrix. This analysis will help us understand the efficiency of each approach and provide insights into their practical applications."

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we implemented and compared three different methods for solving a tridiagonal system of linear equations: a custom Tridiagonal Solver using the Thomas algorithm, matrix inversion using `numpy.linalg.inv`, and direct solution using `numpy.linalg.solve`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The custom Tridiagonal Solver demonstrated significant efficiency advantages due to its tailored approach for tridiagonal matrices. The Thomas algorithm, which has a time complexity of $O(n)$, efficiently handles the tridiagonal structure by performing forward elimination and backward substitution in linear time. This makes it highly suitable for large systems where computational efficiency is critical.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, the matrix inversion method using `numpy.linalg.inv` has a time complexity of $O(n^3)$, as it involves calculating the inverse of the matrix. This method is computationally expensive and less efficient for large matrices, as evidenced by the increasing computation times observed in our experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The direct solution method using `numpy.linalg.solve` is more optimized than matrix inversion, with a time complexity of approximately $O(n^2)$ for dense matrices. However, it does not exploit the sparse structure of the tridiagonal matrix, resulting in slower performance compared to the custom Tridiagonal Solver.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the results highlight the importance of choosing the right algorithm based on the problem's structure and size. For tridiagonal systems, the Thomas algorithm is the clear winner in terms of efficiency, providing fast and accurate solutions with minimal computational overhead. Understanding these differences in time complexity helps in making informed decisions in numerical simulations, especially when dealing with large-scale problems in scientific computing."
