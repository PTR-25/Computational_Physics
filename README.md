## Setup and Installation
To get started with the exercises, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/computational-physics-exercises.git
    cd computational-physics-exercises
    ```

2. **Install the required dependencies:**
    - Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
    - Install the necessary Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
Each exercise is contained in its own directory with the following structure:
|-- exercise-1
| |-- README.md
| |-- solution.py
| |-- data
| |-- input_data.txt
| |-- output_data.txt
|-- exercise-2
| |-- README.md
| |-- solution.py
| |-- data
| |-- input_data.txt
| |-- output_data.txt

- Navigate to the directory of the exercise you wish to work on.
- Read the `README.md` file in the exercise directory for specific instructions.
- Run the provided solutions or implement your own.
